//There are a few Katas about Church Numerals so let's talk about booleans.
//
//In lambda calculus, the only primitive are lambdas. No numbers, no strings, and of course no booleans. Everything is reduced to anonymous functions.
//
//Booleans are defined thusly (this definition is preloaded for you) :
//
//const True = T => F => T;
//const False = T => F => F;
//Your task will be to implement basic operators on booleans (using only lambdas and function application) : Not, And, Or and Xor.
//
//To help, the function unchurch comes preloaded, and returns the native boolean given a church boolean :
//
//unchurch(True); //true;
//Note: You should not use the following:
//
//numbers
//strings
//booleans
//boolean operators
//objects (curly brackets) or arrays (square brackets)
//regexp
//"new"


//solution
const Not = A => A(False)(True);
const And = A => B => A(B)(A);
const Or = A => B => A(A)(B);
const Xor = A => B => A(Not(B))(B);
