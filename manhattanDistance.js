//The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points. What if we were trying to walk from point A to point B, but there were buildings in the way? We would need some other formula..but which?
//
//Manhattan Distance
//Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.
//
//Complete the function that accepts two points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.
//
//The points are arrays or tuples containing the x and y coordinate in the grid. You can think of x as the row in the grid, and y as the column.
//
//Examples
//manhattanDistance( [1, 1], [1, 1] ) // => returns 0
//manhattanDistance( [5, 4], [3, 2] ) // => returns 4
//manhattanDistance( [1, 1], [0, 3] ) // => returns 3


//solution
function manhattanDistance(pointA, pointB){
  return Math.abs(pointA[0]-pointB[0]) + Math.abs(pointA[1]-pointB[1]);
}
