//Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like undefined, null, NaN, negative numbers, strings and so on.
//
//Here is a list of functions, we need:
//
//Math.round()
//Math.ceil()
//Math.floor()


//solution
Math.round = function(number) {
  return parseInt(number.toFixed(0));
}

Math.ceil = function(number) {
  return (number % 1 === 0) ? parseInt(number) : parseInt(number + 1);
}

Math.floor = function(number) {
  return parseInt(number);
}
