//Task
//Given two integers a and b in range 1..20, return true if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10, false otherwise.
//
//Code Limit
//Less than 36 characters.
//
//Example
//For a = 1, b = 10, the answer is true.
//
//Because b is 10.
//
//For a = 10, b = 1, the answer is true.
//
//Because a is 10.
//
//For a = 1, b = 9, the answer is true.
//
//Because a+b is 10.
//
//For a = 1, b = 2, the answer is false.
//
//Because there is no 10.


//solution
makes10=(a,b)=>/10/.test([a+b,a,b])
