//Task
//You are a lonely frog.
//
//You live on a coordinate axis.
//
//The meaning of your life is to jump and jump..
//
//There are only two rules you must follow:
//
//the first and last jumps should be of size 1;
//
//the absolute difference between the lengths of two consecutive jumps should be less than or equal to 1.
//
//Now, here comes your new task. Your starting point is 1, the target point is n.
//
//You need to jump to the target point with minimal steps. Please tell me, what's the minimal steps?
//
//1 <= n <= 10^9
//
//Example
//For n = 5, the output should be 3.
//
// step  from   to   distance
//  1:     1 --> 2       1
//  2:     2 --> 4       2
//  3:     4 --> 5       1
//For n = 14, the output should be 7.
//
// step  from    to   distance
//  1:     1  --> 2       1
//  2:     2  --> 4       2
//  3:     4  --> 7       3
//  4:     7  --> 10      3
//  5:     10 --> 12      2
//  6:     12 --> 13      1
//  7:     13 --> 14      1


//solution
let jumpTo = n => Math.sqrt(n-1.5)*2|0;


//another solution
let jumpTo=n=>(4*n-6)**.5|0
