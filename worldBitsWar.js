//Variation of this nice kata, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).
//
//Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.
//
//Examples:
//
//bitsWar([1,5,12]) => "odds win" //1+101 vs 1100, 3 vs 2
//bitsWar([7,-3,20]) => "evens win" //111-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 2
//bitsWar([7,-3,-2,6]) => "tie" //111-11 vs -1+110, 3-2 vs -1+2


//solution
let bitsWar = function(arr){
    let evens = arr.filter(a=>a%2===0).map(a=> (a === 0) ? 0 : (Math.abs(a) >>> 0).toString(2).match(/1/g).length * (a >= 0 ? 1 : -1)).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
    let odds = arr.filter(a=>a%2!==0).map(a=> (Math.abs(a) >>> 0).toString(2).match(/1/g).length * (a >= 0 ? 1 : -1)).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    return (evens === odds) ? "tie" : (evens > odds) ? "evens win" : "odds win"; 
}
