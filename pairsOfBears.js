//In order to prove it's success and gain funding, the wilderness zoo needs to prove to environmentalists that it has x number of mating pairs of bears.
//
//You must check within string (s) to find all of the mating pairs, and return a string containing only them. Line them up for inspection.
//
//Rules: Bears are either 'B' (male) or '8' (female), Bears must be together in male/female pairs 'B8' or '8B', Mating pairs must involve two distinct bears each ('B8B' may look fun, but does not count as two pairs).
//
//Return an array containing a string of only the mating pairs available. e.g:
//
//'EvHB8KN8ik8BiyxfeyKBmiCMj' ---> 'B88B' (empty string if there are no pairs)
//
//and true if the number is more than or equal to x, false if not:
//
//(6, 'EvHB8KN8ik8BiyxfeyKBmiCMj') ---> ['B88B', false];
//
//x will always be a positive integer, and s will never be empty


//solution
function bears(x, s){
  let arr = s.match(/(8B)|(B8)/g) || [];
  return [arr.join(""), arr.length >= x];
}
