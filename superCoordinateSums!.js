//Given an D-dimension array, where each axis is of length N, your goal is to find the sum of every index in the array starting from 0.
//
//For Example if D=1 and N=10 then the answer would be 45 ([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) If D=2 and N = 3 the answer is 18 which would be the sum of every number in the following:
//
//[
//[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)],
//[(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)],
//[(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
//]
//A naive solution could be to loop over every index in every dimension and add to a global sum. This won't work as the number of dimension is expected to be quite large.
//
//Hint: A formulaic approach would be best Hint 2: Gauss could solve the one dimensional case in his earliest of years, This is just a generalization.
//
//Note for JS version: Because the results will exceed the maximum safe integer easily, for such values you're only required to have a precision of at least 1 in 1e-9 to the actual answer.


//solution
function superSum(D,N) {
  return D * Math.pow(N, D - 1) * (N-1) * N/2
}
