//You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence, but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that *"the"* is doubled in the first sentence of this description?
//
//As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like *"as"* at the beginning of the sentence.
//
//Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next after each other count as one.
//
//Example:
//
//"dog cat"                 --> 0
//"dog DOG cat"             --> 1
//"apple dog cat"           --> 0
//"pineapple apple dog cat" --> 0
//"apple     apple dog cat" --> 1
//"apple dog apple dog cat" --> 0
//"dog dog DOG dog dog dog" --> 1
//"dog dog dog dog cat cat" --> 2
//"cat cat dog dog cat cat" --> 3


//solution
let countAdjacentPairs = str => {

//optimized solution
const countAdjacentPairs=(s)=>(s.match(/(\b\w+\s*\b)\1+/gi)||[]).length
