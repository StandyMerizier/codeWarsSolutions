//A strongness of an even number is the number of times we can successively divide by 2 until we reach an odd number starting with an even number n.
//
//For example, if n = 12, then
//
//12 / 2 = 6
//6 / 2 = 3
//So we divided successively 2 times and we reached 3, so the strongness of 12 is 2.
//
//If n = 16 then
//
//16 / 2 = 8
//8 / 2 = 4
//4 / 2 = 2
//2 / 2 = 1
//we divided successively 4 times and we reached 1, so the strongness of 16 is 4
//
//Task
//Given a closed interval [n, m], return the even number that is the strongest in the interval. If multiple solutions exist return the smallest strongest even number.
//
//Note that programs must run within the allotted server time; a naive solution will probably time out.
//
//Constraints
//1 <= n < m <= INT_MAX
//
//Examples
//[1, 2]    -->   2  # 1 has strongness 0, 2 has strongness 1
//[5, 10]   -->   8  # 5, 7, 9 have strongness 0; 6, 10 have strongness 1; 8 has strongness 3
//[48, 56]  -->  48
