//Consider the sequence S(n, z) = (1 - z)(z + z**2 + z**3 + ... + z**n) where z is a complex number and n a positive integer (n > 0).
//
//When n goes to infinity and z has a correct value (ie z is in its domain of convergence D), S(n, z) goes to a finite limit lim depending on z.
//
//Experiment with S(n, z) to guess the domain of convergence Dof S and lim value when z is in D.
//
//Then determine the smallest integer n such that abs(S(n, z) - lim) < eps where eps is a given small real number and abs(Z) is the modulus or norm of the complex number Z.
//
//Call f the function f(z, eps) which returns n. If z is such that S(n, z) has no finite limit (when z is outside of D) f will return -1.
//
//Examples:
//I is a complex number such as I * I = -1 (sometimes written i or j).
//
//f(0.3 + 0.5 * I, 1e-4) returns 17
//
//f(30 + 5 * I, 1e-4) returns -1
//
//Remark:
//For languages that don't have complex numbers or "easy" complex numbers, a complex number z is represented by two real numbers x (real part) and y (imaginary part).
//
//f(0.3, 0.5, 1e-4) returns 17
//
//f(30, 5, 1e-4) returns -1
//
//Note:
//You pass the tests if abs(actual - exoected) <= 1


//solution
let f = (x, y, eps) => Math.max(-1,Math.log(eps)/Math.log(Math.hypot(x,y)));
