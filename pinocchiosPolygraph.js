//Each time when Pinocchio is not telling the truth his nose should become longer.
//
//Task:
//Write function which determines if pinocchio is telling the truth.
//function extendPinocchiosNose(words){
//  //return true if lying,false otherwise.
//}
//When pinocchio is lying he stutter a bit.If word1 is followed by word2 where word2 contains whole word1(case insensitive) you can tell that pinocchio is lying.
//
////lies examples
//-"I am goo good person" //"good" contains "goo"
//-"In real story they didnt hanged m me" //"me" contains "m"
//-"It is geppetos fault,i would be Good good if not him" //"good" contains "Good"


//solution
function extendPinocchioNose(words){
    words = words.toLowerCase().split(" ");
    for(let i = 0; i < words.length-1; i++)
        if(words[i+1].indexOf(words[i]) > -1)
            return true;
    return false;
}


//another solution
const extendPinocchioNose = s => /\b(\w+)\s+\w*\1\w*\b/i.test(s);
